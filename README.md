## Assignment Description

In this assignment, we will be re-creating the Hunter CS department's website from scratch (https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/csci). This assignment is designed to help you get comfortable writing a web page from scratch using native HTML/CSS (no frameworks, CSS libs, etc...), and help you get familiar with how web pages are set up.

You will be provided all the assets you need to re-create the site, which includes CSS color values, images and copy texts that were copied over from our school/department's current website. You are also welcomed to use any additional assets that you'd, feel free to swap out any of the template assets/code to your liking. Mockups for the site/pages are also provided in the assets folder.

Also, keeping in line with agile development practices, the various tasks for this assignment will be outlined in the form of user stories, each describing how the user expects to interact with our site. Grading rubric for this assignment will be attached to each of the user stories listed below. Total points for this asignment is 180pts.
