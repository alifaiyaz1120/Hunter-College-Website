            <p> The Department of Computer Science is located at Hunter's 68th street campus 
            on the upper east side of Manhattan. Providing students with outstanding preparation 
            both for employment as computer professionals and for future graduate study, the department
             expects students to construct creative solutions to challenging problems in a variety 
             of contexts. The small but diverse faculty works closely with students in an open 
             and collegial atmosphere. Our curriculum focuses on hands-on programming skills 
             as well as the theoretical foundations that support current technology and will 
             guide its future development.
